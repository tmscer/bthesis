# Text Embeddings for Recommender Systems

This is my bachelor thesis at CTU FEE supervised by Ing. Jan Drchal, Ph.D. ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.cz/citations?user=JL9IGwcAAAAJ), [CTU website](https://cs.felk.cvut.cz/en/people/drchajan))

### Description

The task is to compare various embeddings and their usability in recommender systems.

### Requirements

1. Research state-of-the-art in text embeddings. Explore both contextual (e.g., BERT) and non-contextual (e.g., Word2Vec) approaches.
2. Select existing dataset and build a recommender system.
3. Select an appropriate evaluation methodology.
4. Compare embeddings with TF-IDF and/or similar baseline.
